# MAKEFILE TEMPLATE

## Description

This script automatically creates a Makefile for your project. Currently it only supports C/C++/C#, but I will extend it in the future to support other languages.

## Usage

The script can be installed as follow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isthattyler/Makefile-Template.git
cd Makefile-Template
./install
```
